## 🏗 Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/economic-data` - Current economic indicators
  - `GET /api/ubi-calculation` - AI-calculated UBI recommendations
  - `POST /api/simulate` - Run custom simulations
  - `GET /api/scenarios` - Pre-configured scenarios
  - `GET /api/news-sentiment` - Sentiment analysis data

- **AI Calculation Engine**:
  - Considers unemployment rate, inflation, cost of living
  - Applies sentiment analysis adjustments
  - Calculates total program costs

### Frontend (React/Material-UI)
- **Components**:
  - Dashboard: Main visualization and metrics
  - SimulationControls: Interactive parameter adjustment
  - ScenarioLibrary: Preset scenario selection
  - TransparencyPanel: AI explanation and reporting

- **Visualizations**:
  - Economic indicators chart (Bar)
  - UBI calculation breakdown (Line)
  - Program impact distribution (Doughnut)
  - Real-time data status

## 📈 UBI Calculation Algorithm

The AI calculates UBI payouts using a weighted formula:

```javascript
// Base calculation factors
unemploymentFactor = max(0.5, unemployment / 10)
inflationFactor = max(0.8, inflation / 5)  
costOfLivingFactor = costOfLiving / 100

// Base payout calculation
basePayout = (averageIncome * 0.1) * unemploymentFactor * inflationFactor * costOfLivingFactor

// Sentiment adjustment
sentimentMultiplier = 1 + (sentimentScore * 0.1)
finalPayout = basePayout * sentimentMultiplier
```

## 🎮 How to Demo the Application

### Live Demo Flow
1. **Start the application** using `./start.sh` or `npm run dev`
2. **Main Dashboard**: Shows real-time UBI calculation with live economic data
3. **Try Scenarios**: Click "Economic Crisis" in the Scenario Library to see how UBI adapts
4. **Manual Simulation**: Use sliders in Simulation Controls to adjust unemployment or inflation
5. **View Transparency**: Scroll down to see AI decision explanations and factor analysis
6. **Export Data**: Click "Export Report" to generate shareable reports

### Demo Talking Points
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Data updates every 30 seconds, UBI adjusts automatically
- **Crisis Response**: Crisis scenario shows UBI increasing from $2,279 to ~$4,200
- **AI Transparency**: Every decision is explained with clear factor breakdowns
