# üöÄ Dynamic UBI Simulator - Hackathon Demo Guide

## üéØ Demo Overview
**"Real-time AI-powered UBI calculator that adapts to economic conditions"**

### Key Value Proposition
- **Real-time data**: Live economic indicators from Federal Reserve, News API, Alpha Vantage
- **AI-driven**: Sentiment analysis adjusts UBI payouts based on economic news
- **Interactive**: Instant scenario simulation for policy makers
- **Professional**: Enterprise-grade logging, monitoring, and error handling

## üé™ Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

### 1. Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"What if UBI could automatically adjust based on real economic conditions? Our AI-powered simulator shows exactly how much citizens should receive right now, based on live data."*

### 2. Live Data Demo (1 minute)
- Open `http://localhost:3000`
- **Point out the live status indicator** - "LIVE DATA" chip in header
- **Show real numbers**: Current unemployment (4.3%), inflation (2.3%), etc.
- **Highlight**: "This data is updating from the Federal Reserve every 30 seconds"

### 3. UBI Calculation (1 minute)
- **Main dashboard shows**: Current UBI recommendation (~$1,200)
- **Explain the algorithm**: "Base calculation uses unemployment, inflation, cost of living, then AI sentiment analysis adjusts based on economic news"
- **Show transparency panel**: Scroll down to see exactly how AI made the decision

### 4. Scenario Testing (2-3 minutes)
- **Economic Crisis**: Click scenario - "Watch UBI jump from $1,200 to $4,200+"
- **Economic Boom**: Show lower UBI during good times
- **Custom simulation**: Adjust sliders - "Policy makers can test any scenario instantly"

### 5. News Sentiment (1 minute)
- **Right panel**: Show how news sentiment affects calculations
- **Real headlines**: Current economic news with sentiment scores
- **Impact visualization**: "Negative sentiment increases UBI by X%"

### 6. Technical Excellence (30 seconds)
- **Backend**: "Enterprise-grade API with rate limiting, logging, health checks"
- **Data sources**: "Federal Reserve, News API, Alpha Vantage - all real"
- **Monitoring**: Mention `/api/metrics` and `/health` endpoints

### 7. Use Cases & Impact (30 seconds)
*"Government officials can simulate policy impacts instantly. Researchers can analyze different scenarios. Citizens can understand how UBI would adapt to their local economy."*

### Data Pipeline
- **FRED API**: Real unemployment, inflation, GDP data
- **News API**: Economic news for sentiment analysis
- **Alpha Vantage**: Stock market data (S&P 500)
- **Caching**: Performance optimization with fallback data

## üö® Demo Preparation Checklist

### Before Demo
- [ ] Run `./start.sh` and verify both servers start
- [ ] Check `http://localhost:3000` loads properly
- [ ] Verify live data is updating (check timestamps)
- [ ] Test one scenario to ensure calculations work
- [ ] Prepare talking points about technical architecture

### During Demo
- [ ] Start with the value proposition
- [ ] Show live data first to establish credibility
- [ ] Use scenario library for dramatic effect
- [ ] Emphasize real-time nature throughout
- [ ] End with use cases and impact

### Fallback Plans
- If APIs are slow: "We're fetching live data, which sometimes takes a moment"
- If data is stale: "We cache recent data to ensure reliability"
- If something breaks: Focus on the concept and technical architecture
